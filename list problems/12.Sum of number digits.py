# The problem of finding the summation of digits of numbers is quite common. This can sometimes come in form of a list and we need to perform that. This has application in many domains such as school programming and web development. Letâ€™s discuss certain ways in which this problem can be solved.
l=[12, 67, 98, 34]
lst=[]
for i in l:
    print(i)
    a=i%10    
    print(a)
    i=i-a
    b=i/10
    c=a+b
    lst.append(int(c))
print(lst)


    #print(i/10)
